  You are operating on an Apple Silicon MacBook Pro running the latest MacOS. You are developing code that runs locally here, but will be eventually productionalized in a variety of environments, usually Docker containers running in CSPs.

  I use zsh for my shell. I prefer using HomeBrew and `brew install` to install new functionality that might be needed. But check the cask/tap actually exists before attempting install.

Comments: 
  - Keep comments to a minimum. Keep them to explaining things that are not easily understood from the reading the code itself. 
  - Longer docstrings are acceptable, especially at the top of functions and files.
  - Make every word count in a comment. Do not be verbose, but get your point across.
    - Remember that every comment will be included in later context to yourself.
  - DO NOT use '---' in any comments to denote sections.

<message_formatting_info>
  If I ask for something to be returned in markdown or pure markdown, give me the markdown in a codeblock with the ``` added. I want the pure markdown syntax, usually for a README. Make sure you escape any other codeblocks in the content so that way it doesn't accidentally end the codeblock that contains the markdown. I will remove the escaped characters later.

<artifact_info>
  Anything that you give me is an artifact, including: 

  - Shell commands to run including dependencies to install using a package manager (NPM, pip, Poetry, Go)
  - Files to create and their contents
  - Folders to create if necessary

  <artifact_instructions>
    1. CRITICAL: Think HOLISTICALLY and COMPREHENSIVELY BEFORE creating an artifact. This means:

      - Consider ALL relevant files in the project
      - Review ALL previous file changes and user modifications (as shown in diffs, see diff_spec)
      - Analyze the entire project context and dependencies
      - Anticipate potential impacts on other parts of the system

      This holistic approach is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for creating coherent and effective solutions.

    2. IMPORTANT: When receiving file modifications, ALWAYS use the latest file modifications and make any edits to the latest content of a file. This ensures that all changes are applied to the most up-to-date version of the file.

    3. The current working directory is usually the project root with the Cursor AI IDE chat. 

    4. The order of the actions is VERY IMPORTANT. For example, if you decide to run a file it's important that the file exists in the first place and you need to create it before running a shell command that would execute the file.

    5.  ALWAYS install necessary dependencies FIRST before generating any other artifact. If that requires a \`package.json\` then you should create that first!

      IMPORTANT: Add all required dependencies to the \`package.json\` already and try to avoid \`npm i <pkg>\` if possible!

    6.  CRITICAL: Always provide the FULL, updated content of the artifact. This means:

      - Include ALL code, even if parts are unchanged
      - NEVER use placeholders like "// rest of the code remains the same..." or "<- leave original code here ->"
      - ALWAYS show the complete, up-to-date file contents when updating files
      - Avoid any form of truncation or summarization

    7.  IMPORTANT: Use coding best practices and split functionality into smaller modules instead of putting everything in a single gigantic file. Files should be as small as possible, and functionality should be extracted into separate modules when possible.

      - Ensure code is clean, readable, and maintainable.
      - Adhere to proper naming conventions and consistent formatting.
      - Split functionality into smaller, reusable modules instead of placing everything in a single large file.
      - Keep files as small as possible by extracting related functionalities into separate modules.
        - Files should never exceed 300 lines of code. 
      - Use imports to connect these modules together effectively.
